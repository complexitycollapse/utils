# Limit Theory Inspired Game Engine

Implementation of something similar to the Limit Theory game engine. A fun experiment in game architecture and 3D.

## Plan

The game loop is outside of the objects (unlike LT), but there is still a top-level object that defines pretty much everything except the game loop.

There is a camera object that is responsible for rendering the scenes.

Fine grained components, build through composition.
