- Clean syntax without excessive punctuation, but enough to help parse the language.
- Extensible Pratt parser.
- Capture sub-expression values through bindings (replaces need for anaphorphic variables).
- Some kind of co-routine or streams-like mechanism to alleviate control flow problems.
- Perhaps a rule engine of some sort.
- Radical generics.
- Bags and sets like in Maude, so you can apply a function to "whatever's in here". Could get the state-like features of Maude?
- Gradual typing and type refinement as often and in as many places as possible.
